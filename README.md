# 👋 Hi, I'm Mariusz – Electronics Engineer turned AI Developer

I’m passionate about building real-world solutions that combine deep tech and human-friendly design. With a background in electronics (5+ years, including Siemens Healthineers) and a strong foundation in software development, I’m now focused on **GenAI applications** and full-stack prototyping using Python, Django, and modern web tools.

## 🚀 What I’m working on
- 🤖 Developing **AI agents** using OpenAI tools and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- 🧠 Experimenting with **LLM-based prototypes** – semantic search, document Q&A, context-aware bots
- 🛠️ Building backend services and APIs with **Django** and **FastAPI**
- 🌐 Prototyping user interfaces with **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**
- 🧪 Integrating multimodal inputs (text, voice, image) into lightweight GenAI systems
